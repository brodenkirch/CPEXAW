Data Availability Statement:

Information on the NASA CPEX 2017 campaign is available at the main project page: https://cpex.jpl.nasa.gov/cpex2017/ 
which includes a link to the processed data used in this analysis: https://tcis.jpl.nasa.gov/data/cpex/ (Chen & Zipser, 2017). 
From this link, data used in the analysis is accessed from the latest versions of the APR-3, DAWN, and dropsonde folders with no registration required for access. 
These folders also include the README files referenced in the text. 
Visualizations of the CPEX data that aid analysis can be created from the CPEX data portal at the following link: https://cpexportal.jpl.nasa.gov/. 

For NASA CPEX-AW 2021 datasets, the main project page is found here: https://cpex.jpl.nasa.gov/cpex-aw/
with no similar direct link to the data repository (Skofronick-Jackson et al., 2021).
The CPEX-AW data is freely accessible through registering at the NASA EarthData repository following this campaign-specific link: https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?fpj=CPEX-AW.
To access this data by instrument, see the main site for:
the entire CPEX-AW data collection (http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/CPEXAW/DATA101) and direct links therein for accessing:
APR-3 data (https://dx.doi.org/10.5067/CPEXAW/APR3/DATA101),
DAWN data (http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/ASDC/SUBORBITAL/CPEXAW-DAWN_DC8_1), and 
dropsonde data (http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/ASDC/SUBORBITAL/CPEXAW-Dropsondes_1) that were used for this analysis. 
Visualizations of the CPEX-AW data that aid analysis can be created from the CPEX-AW data portal at the following link: https://cpex-aw.jpl.nasa.gov/.

TPW data used in the analysis is publicly available via Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (2023), 
as is the IMERG data used for analysis through the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (Huffman et al., 2019). 
ECMWF ERA5 divergence and component wind data used for analysis of near-storm horizontal convergence and streamlines, respectively, 
is publicly available through the Copernicus Climate Change Service Climate Data Store (Hersbach et al., 2018).
